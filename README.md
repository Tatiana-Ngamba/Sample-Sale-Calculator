# Sample-Sale-Calculator - Javascript

I have created a Sample Sale Calculator for 'KAI Collective'. The Fashion Brand has been opened for 6 years now and the owner would like to celebrate by hosting a sample sale.
The owner has decided to make this sample sale efficient, she will divide all items into 4 categories. Each with its own unique price. 

- Yellow Items (Bikinis) £10,
- Red Items (Tops) £15.99,
- Green Items (Dresses & Trousers) £25.99,
- White Items (Coats) £30,

She wants a self-checkout calculator that is efficient and quick for users to use and pay for the items that they are buying.

Customers should be able to interact with the application by clicking on buttons representing these colours and selecting the quantity of items customers want to purchase. 

**The calculator should then calculate the total cost by adding up the prices of all the items purchased and generating a receipt to present for the customer.**
